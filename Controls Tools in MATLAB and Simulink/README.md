## Controls Tools in MATLAB/Simulink

MATLAB/Simulinkâ„¢ has a variety of built in control system design and tuning 
functions. This project explores some of these functions to plot the root locus, 
to design control systems and to simulate the results.

This project was a great introduction to using Simulink Control Systems Designer to build effective controllers that can be tuned to a desired functionality.
