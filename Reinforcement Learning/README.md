# Advanced Mechanical Systems
## Reinforcement Learning
This program follows an online MATLAB tutorial that discusses making a model of a water tank system, setting up the environment interface, creating a DDPG agent and training and validating it, then using RL to make a dynamic controller for the system. My favorite part about this control scheme is that it can essentially adapt to changes in the system and rediscover an optimal control method. You need MATLABs Machine Learning Toolbox to run this program.
