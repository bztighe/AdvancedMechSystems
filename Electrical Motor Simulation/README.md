## Electric Motor Simulation and Control

The first part of this project uses Simulink to model an electric motor given the following schematic:

The model is summarized using the following two ordinary differential equations:

where 𝐽, 𝑏,𝐾, 𝐿, 𝑅 are constants for a specific motor, 𝜃 is the rotational angle for the motor 
shaft, and 𝑖 is current going through the armature (the values for these variables were given).The project goes on to use Sumulink Control System Designer to impliment lead and lag compensators to control the system. This was a great introduction to Simulink and some of the tools they have available.
