## Hydraulic Ram Pump


A hydraulic ram pump is a type of water pump that is particularly interesting for
developing world applications. It uses only the passive dynamics of hydraulic systems (no 
electricity or conventional power) to pump water uphill.
A schematic of a hydraulic ram pump is shown below.

The way that the pump works is that the input tank provides a 
little bit of pressure to the supply pipe. The supply pipe is a long pipe made of steel or other 
non-compliant piping material. When the water rushes through the supply pipe and through 
the waste valve, it creates a drag force on the waste valve, closing it. The sudden closing of 
the waste valve creates a pressure spike in the right side of the supply pipe because of the 
hydraulic inertia of the fluid in the supply pipe. This pressure spike opens the delivery valve 
and allows the water to flow into the delivery tank. The delivery tank has a bladder or bubble
of air which creates a hydraulic capacitance. This hydraulic capacitance stores the pressure 
of the pressure spike to pump water uphill to the output tank. As the water flows up the 
delivery valve, the pressure under the waste valve decreases until the waste valve opens 
again and the delivery valve closes. The cycle repeats at approximately 1 Hz to pump water 
up hill.
