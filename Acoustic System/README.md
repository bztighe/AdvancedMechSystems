# Advanced Mechanical Systems
## Acuostical System

Acoustic domain system dynamics are very important for modeling and design of 
the intake and exhaust systems of engines. This program shows the modeled behavior of 
Helmholtz resonators, which it turns out can be used to reduce the 
intake noise of engines. In a similar way, we can design mufflers for the exhaust system of 
engines using these same techniques.

This project was a great way to begin to build some intuition in this space of less-than-tangible systems.
